## Code of Conduct

Please read and take note of the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) by which we expect everybody to abide.

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.

We’d like to highlight these behaviours in particular:


* Use welcoming and inclusive language

* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences

* Gracefully accept constructive criticism

* Focus on what is best for the community

* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the organisers, presenter or a helper as soon as possible.
