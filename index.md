# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

## Course description

This workshop will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks. You will learn what they are, what they do and why you might like to use them.

It is an introductory set of lessons for those who are brand new, have little or no knowledge of coding and computational methods in research.

By the end of the workshop you will have a good understanding of what notebooks can do, how to open one up, perform some basic tasks and save it for later.

If you are really into it, you will also be able to continue to experiment after the workshop by using other people's notebooks as springboards for your own adventures!

## Who is this workshop for?

This workshop is targeted at those who are absolute beginners or ‘tech-curious’. It includes a hands-on component, using basic programming commands, but requires no previous knowledge of programming.

# Workshop aims

>## Learning Objectives
